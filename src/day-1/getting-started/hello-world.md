# Hello, World

Let us jump into the simplest possible Rust program, a classic Hello World
program:

```rust
fn main() {
  println!("Hello World!");
}
```

#### What you see:

- Functions are introduced with `fn`.
- Blocks are delimited by curly braces like in C and C++.
- The `main` function is the entry point of the program.
- Rust has hygienic macros, `println!` is an example of this.
- Rust strings are UTF-8 encoded and can contain any Unicode character.
