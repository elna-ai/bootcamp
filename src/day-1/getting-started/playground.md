# Playground

The [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/) provides an easy way to run
short Rust programs, and is the basis for the examples and exercises in this
course. Try running the "hello-world" program it starts with. It comes with a
few handy features:

- Under "Tools", use the `rustfmt` option to format your code in the "standard"
  way.

- Rust has two main "profiles" for generating code: Debug (extra runtime checks,
  less optimization) and Release (fewer runtime checks, lots of optimization).
  These are accessible under "Debug" at the top.

- If you're interested, use "ASM" under "..." to see the generated assembly
  code.
