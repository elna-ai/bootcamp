# Welcome to Day 2

This chapter covers concepts that appear in almost every programming language and how they work in Rust. Many programming languages have much in common at their core.

Specifically, youâ€™ll learn about variables, basic types, functions, comments, and control flow. These foundations will be in every Rust program, and learning them early will give you a strong core to start from.
